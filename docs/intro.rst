Getting Started
===============

The main class of PyMeshLab is the :ref:`meshset` class. It represents the current state of MeshLab (containing a set of meshes, rasters...). See the documentation of the :ref:`meshset` class for more details.

After installing PyMeshLab through pip:

.. code-block:: python

   import pymeshlab as ml
   ms = ml.MeshSet()

You can load, save meshes and apply MeshLab filters:

.. code-block:: python

   ms.load_new_mesh('airplane.obj')
   ms.apply_filter('convex_hull')
   ms.save_current_mesh('convex_hull.ply')

You can list all the available filters and theirs parameters:

.. code-block:: python

   ms.print_filter_list()
   ms.print_filter_parameter_list('surface_reconstruction_screened_poisson')

And apply filters with your parameters:

.. code-block:: python

   ms.apply_filter('noisy_isosurface', resolution=128)

The ``apply_filter`` function, most of the times, will return an empty dictionary. This is because the filter applied does not need to return anything.
Most of the MeshLab filters will change in some way the state of the MeshSet. The behaviour of how filters change the state is the same of what
happens when applying the same filter in MeshLab. However, some filters return values:

.. code-block:: python

   out_dict = ms.apply_filter('compute_geometric_measures')
   print(out_dict['surface_area'])

To run the tests:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip3 install pytest
   pytest --pyargs pymeshlab
